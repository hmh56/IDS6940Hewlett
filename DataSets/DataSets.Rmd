# This data set already might be "quantiled" I don't know how to say it but not a great candidate since clearly it seems to have been already broken into groups. There would be some data cleaning that would need to happen. It seems that the group and subgroup categories are pretty messy with all sorts of different categorical values.

#This one might be a better candidate. I can see the zipcodes being broken into quantiles based on the funding. IDK what we could research but potential? Maybe have a hypothesis that the more population desnity your zipcode is the more funding you get? See if it holds trues. Analyze by quantile.
