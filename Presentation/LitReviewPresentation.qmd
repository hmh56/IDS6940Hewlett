## Quantile Regression

-   In 1978 Koenker and Bassett introduced ideas to the estimation of conditional quantile functions
-   Quantile Regression vs. Linear Regression
-   One Average vs. Several Averages
-   One Group vs. Multiple Groups

Koenker, R., & Hallock, K. F. (2019). Quantile regression. *Nature Methods, 15*(4), 143–156. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0406-y

## Quantile Regression 40 Years On

-   No longer rely fully on Gaussian methods in some instances
-   Quantile can show asymmetires and tail behavior
-   Quantile Treatment Effect (QTE) is easily implemented as long as treatment is randomly assigned
-   Interactions have significant effects on Quantiles
-   Quantile provides a foundation for nonparametric structural models
-   The old assumption was that all things empirical can be revelaed by their conditional means
-   Time Series Models used to be dominated by Gaussian methods
-   Information was lost using Gaussian when it came to the tail and asymmetries
-   As data gets more complex and hetergeneity gains attention, Quantile methods become more favorable

## Thinking Beyond the Mean, Quantile Methods in Health Services Research

-   Ordinary Least Squares and Logistic Regression assume coefficients remain constant
-   These methods do not look at the group differences that are important
-   Quantile is great for variables that ahave distinct categorical groups
-   Quantile is not simply a regression estimated in quantiles
-   Allows the relaxation of the common regression assumptions
-   We try to minimize the weighted difference in Quantile Regression
-   Quantile amplifies the ability to tell the difference in the upper and lower areas of the data
-   Downside is that you cut your population everytime you add a quantile

## Quantile Regression - Opportunities and Challenges from a User's Perspective

-   Quantile is a stistical technique used to model quantiles within a regression framework
-   Quantile is great for skewed datasets
-   Some studies create their own "quantiles" in the requirements for a study group (have age cut offs)
-   Quantile is difficult to visualize and understand an overall summary of a data set
-   Less sensitive to outliers

Beyerlein, A. (2014). Quantile regression—opportunities and challenges from a user's perspective. *American Journal of Epidemiology, 180*(3), 330–331. https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwu178

## No Crossing Single Index Quantile Regression Curve Estimation

-   Thinking about Quantile formulas, they have to eventually cross
-   This is problematic if you are estimating outside of your quantile you are observing and this is frowned upon
-   The "curse of dimensionality" is real in Quantile
-   It is intersting to see these crosses

Jiang, R., & Yu, K. (2023). No-crossing single-index quantile regression curve estimation. *Journal of Business & Economic Statistics, 41*(2), 309–320. https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2021.2013245

## Efficient Quantile Regression Analysis with Missing Observations

-   Quantiles are great for having outliers because they are very resistant to the outliers
-   When you have missing data, inverse probability weighing methods are great to use
-   I will use .naomit

## Quantile regression: overview and selected applications

-   The author provides an overview of quantile regression and illustrates two of its applications.
-   Variables may enjoy unique relationships within different sections of a distribution, which can be more readily identified using quantile regression.
-   The author notes this method is useful when working with non-Gaussian distributions

Buhai, S. (2005). Quantile regression: overview and selected applications. *Ad Astra, 4*(4), 1-17.

## Increasing sensitivity of results by using quantile regression analysis for exploring community resilience

-   The authors used quantile regression to evaluate the relationships between community demographics and perceived resilience.
-   The distribution was divided into percentiles and quartiles.
-   A significant relationship was identified inside several quantiles that were not significant when using linear regression on the entire distribution.
-   The authors note that quantile regression is a non-parametric method, meaning no assumptions are made about the sample size or the normality of the distribution.

## Quantile regression

-   The equation for quantile regression is $$Q_Y(\tau \mid X) = X \beta(\tau)$$
-   Q is the quantile function, τ represents the quantile of interest, Y is the response variable given the X predictor variable(s), and β is the regression coefficient.

Koenker, R. (2005). *Quantile regression*. Cambridge University Press.

## Quantile regression

-   The authors explain quantile regression and contrast it against linear regression.
-   Quantile regression allows the data scientist to learn about the predictor variables’ relationships with an outcome variable from a tiered perspective.
-   Quantile regression is less affected by extreme values since it is not reliant on means.
-   This approach is especially useful when the relationships of interest are primarily located in an upper or lower quartile.

## Goodness of fit and related inference processes for quantile regression

-   The authors identified the absence of a suitable goodness-of-fit assessment for quantile regression.
-   They developed a method with inspiration from R2, which is the coefficient of determination.
-   Their methods are Δn(τ), Wn(τ), and Tn(τ)
-   These new methods expanded the capacity for quantile regression inference.
-   The theory behind these new methods is beyond the scope of this course.

## Quantiles for counts

-   The authors explored the use of quantile regression for count data.
-   By incorporating artificial smoothness, the authors were able to make inferences about the conditional quartiles.
-   This method is likely far outside the scope of our project but provides a reference point for defining quantile regression, its applications, and limitations.

## Use of quantile regression to determine the impact on total health care costs of surgical site infections following common ambulatory procedures

-   The authors employed quantile regression in a retrospective cohort study using data from insurer claims.
-   The intent was to identify factors affecting costs of infections following inpatient surgical procedures.
-   Serious infections were categorized as those occurring in hospital or needing follow-up surgery, and were found to be the most costly.
-   Quantile regression allowed the authors to focus on different factors associated with costs for the serious surgical infections located within that quantile.

## Quantile regression and its applications: A primer for anesthesiologists

-   The authors utilized QR to understand relationships between ventilator dependence and hospital length-of-stay.
-   The authors suspected these relationships changed across different quantiles.
-   The authors found stronger relationships between the predictor variables inside the upper quantiles of the length of stay outcome.

## Quantile regression: A short story on how and why

-   The author utilized body mass index (BMI) data to illustrate the usefulness of quantile regression.
-   The goal was to answer questions about the outer portions of the distribution, which in this case was boys with the highest BMI.\
-   Quantile regression afforded insight into how predictor variables can have stronger or weaker effects within different areas of the distribution.
